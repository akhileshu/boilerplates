Why end = start + 5 or 10 secs is useful:
Keeps the highlight visible long enough for the user to read.

No need to ask the user to manually set end time (simplifies UX).

Works well for short headings, bullets, or summary points.

<!-- @highlight=60-70 -->
If the user is at t=60, you can auto-set end = 60 + 5 (or 10).
